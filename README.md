# Project Name
Production and Propagation of the Jupiter Radio Signal in the Jovian Magnetosphere

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to investigate Jupiterâ€™s magnetosphere (magnetic field) and work out whether there was a connection between the compression of the magnetosphere by the solar wind and the production of a nKom (narrowband kilometric) radio signal coming from Jupiter itself.

## Project Description
The aim of this study was to investigate the behaviour of Jovian narrowband kilometric radio emission (nKom) during periods of magnetospheric compression using the data collected by the Juno spacecraft. Modelling is used to identify periods of magnetospheric compression and visualisation tools then
help to analyse nKom emission during compression periods.


## Outcomes

It is found that the compression of the Jovian magnetosphere by the solar wind results in the activation of nKom sources. The emissions observed during compression typically occur in bursts, with two or three bursts observed throughout a compression period. 
The emissions display a ten-hour periodicity which indicates that the emission source is longitudinally fixed and rotating with Jupiter. 
In addition to this, nKom emissions are observed to change frequency after several rotations which is believed to be as a result of the emission source moving to areas of higher or lower plasma density inside the Io torus. From the findings in this study, it is concluded that observations of nKom emission may be used as a proxy for solar wind conditions at Jupiter.
